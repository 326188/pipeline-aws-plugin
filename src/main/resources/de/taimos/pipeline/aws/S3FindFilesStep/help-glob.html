<div>
	<p>
		This is the glob to use to match files/folders.
		You may use a full file name/path (for example "path/to/file.ext"), but you may also use a glob (for example, "path/t*/file.*").
	</p>
	<p>
		If left blank, this will perform the equivalent function of "*".
	</p>
	<p>
		To list absolutely everything, use "**".
